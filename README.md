# raytracer

Run the following commands to get an output image in ppm format: <br />
`make` <br />
`./raytracer <input_scene>.xml` <br />

You can find input scenes in `input` folder.

Here are example outputs converted to png format (as GitHub doesn't support preview for ppm images):

![bunny.png](outputs/png/bunny.png)
![horse_and_mug.png](outputs/png/horse_and_mug.png)
